## Description:

The significance of the media within modern societies should not be underplayed. Media outlets reflect the present states of their respective regions all around the world. Political elections, international and domestic affairs, and the general mood of a population can be encapsulated, and even strongly influenced, by what’s being reported in the news. The general purpose of this project is to examine the relationship the media has with society. We will be examining the patterns of style the news has throughout time, especially during major political cycles, determining if there are any markings in reporting that could predict domestic and international conflict, and monitor the way media has changed throughout time.  
  
We will be collecting a series of features from GDELT to evaluate in order to reach our project’s objective. Data relating to the tone of a piece, key actors of articles, geographical and temporal information, potential impact, and the types of articles will be collected.In this project we will consider the tone of the media which is analyzed by google with some power algorithms as the stability measurement. This data will be used to determine whether or not these features can be used to predict conflict in the future by comparing the data patterns to the expected pattern, such as negative or positive correlation and/or tendency.
